# MachineLearningBMI
This is a machine learning project that uses regression models and the Super Vector Machine algorithm to predict what health category an individual will be in using predictive analytics. The user will enter his or her gender, height, and weight (in kilograms) and this model will predict how healthy you are. Uses pandas, sklearn, numpy, and seaborn libraries.
